1. Init hook Introduction

Init hook presents global initialization hook mechanism, which allows code
anywhere in the system to define an init hook that is called at increasing
init levels as the system is initialized.

An init hook which is called at the run level specified. Hooks are guaranteed
to be called in order of init level. Within an init level, the order of the
hooks is not guaranteed.

void hook_test(unsigned int level)
{
        dbg_printf(DL_EMERG, "hook 1 level: %x\n", level);
